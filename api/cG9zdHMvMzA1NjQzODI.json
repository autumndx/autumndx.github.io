Under the huge elm trees, we could see yellow dandelions popping through the grass in bunches, as if a painter had touched our landscape with dabs9 of gold .I watched my mother casually10 bend down by one of the clumps11. “I think I’m going to dig up all these weeds, “she said, yanking a blossom up by its roots.”From now on, we’ll have only roses in this garden.”<br>　　那真是一个可爱的春日，棚架上蔷薇的藤蔓正在转青。在一些高大的榆树下面，我们可以看到，一丛丛黄色的蒲公英冒出草坪，仿佛是一位画家为了给眼前的美景增色而着意加上的点点金色。我看到母亲在一簇花丛旁漫不经心地弯下身来。”我看得把这些野草都拨了，”她说着，一边使劲把一丛蒲公英连根拨出。”往后咱这园子里只让长蔷薇花。”<br>　　“But I like dandelions, “I protested. “All flowers are beautiful-even dandelions. “My mother looked at me seriously.”Yes, every flower gives pleasure in its own way, doesn’t it?” She asked thoughtfully.

Lunchtimes were spent reading over my lines and talking abut13 what I would wear.<br>　　往后的几个星期，在母亲的一再鼓励下，我渐渐地以担任旁白的角色感到骄傲。利用午饭时间，我们又一起念台词，议论到时候我该穿什么样的演出服装。<br>　　Backstage the night of the performance, I felt nervous. A few minutes before the play, my teacher came over to me. “Your mother asked me to give this to you, “ she said, handing me a dandelion. Its edges were already beginning to curl and it flopped14 lazily from its stem. But just looking at it, knowing my mother was out there and thinking of our lunchtime talk, made me proud.<br>　　到了演出那个晚上，当我登上后台，心里还感到紧张。离演出还有几分钟的时候，老师朝我走了过来。”你母亲让我把这个交给你，”说着她递过来了一朵蒲公英。那花儿四周已开始打蔫，花瓣儿从梗上向下有气无力地耷拉着。可是，只要看一眼，知道母亲就在外面呆着，回想起和母亲用午饭时说的那些话，我就感到胸有成竹。<br>　　After the play, I took home the flower I had stuffed in the apron15 of my costume. My mother pressed it between two sheets of paper toweling in a dictionary, laughing as she did it that we were perhaps the only people who would press such a sorry-looking weed.<br>　　演出结束后，我把塞在演出服围裙里的那朵蒲公英拿回了家。母亲将花接了过去，用两张纸巾将它压平，夹在了一本字典里。她一边忙碌着，一边笑，想到也许只有我们俩会珍藏这么一朵打了蔫的野草花。<br>　　I often look back on our lunchtimes together, bathed in the soft midday light. They were the commas in my childhood, the pauses that told me life is not savored16 in premeasured increment17, but in the sum of daily rituals and small pleasures we casually share with loved ones. Over peanut-butter sandwiches and chocolate-chip cookies, I learned that love, first and foremost, means being there for the little things.<br>　　我常常回想起和母亲在一起度过的那些沐浴在和煦阳光之中的午餐时光。它们是我孩提时代的一个个小插曲，告诉我一个道理：人生的滋味，就在于和我们所爱的人在一起不经意地共度的日常生活、分享的点点滴滴的欢乐，而不在于某种事先测量好的”添加剂”。在享用母亲做的花生酱、三明治和巧克力碎末小甜饼的时候，我懂得了，爱就体现在这些细微这处。<br>　　A few months ago, my mother came to visit. I took off a day from work and treated her to lunch. The restaurant bustled18 with noontime activity as businesspeople made deals and glanced at their watches. In the middle of all this sat my mother, now retired19, and I. From her face I could see that she relished20 the pace of the work world.<br>　　几个月前，母亲又来看我。我特意请了天假，陪母亲吃午饭。中午，饭馆里熙熙壤攘，做生意的人忙不迭地从事交易活动，他们不时地看看手表。如今已经退休的母亲和我就坐在这群人中间。从母亲的表情中，我看得出，母亲打心眼里喜欢上班族这种生活的节奏。<br>　　“Mom, you must have been terribly bored staying at home when I was a child,” I said.”Bored? Housework is boring. But you were never boring. “<br>　　“妈，我小的时候，您老呆在家里一定觉得很烦吧？”我说。”烦？做家务是令人心烦，不过，你从来没使我感到心烦过。<br>　　“I didn’t believe her, so I pressed.”Surely children are not as stimulating21 as a career.”<br>　　我不相信这是实话，于是我又想法子套她的话。”看孩子哪会像工作那样富有刺激性呢？”<br>　　“A career is stimulating,” she said.” I’m glad I had one. But a career is like an open balloon. It remains22 inflated23 only as long as you keep pumping. A child is a seed. You water it. You care for it the best you can. And then it grows all by itself into a beautiful flower.”<br>　　“工作是富有刺激性的，”母亲答道，”很高兴我也有过工作。可是工作好比开了口的气球，你只有不停地充气，它才能鼓着劲。可是一个孩子就是一粒种子，你浇灌了它，全心全意地爱护它，然后，它就会独立自主地开出美丽的花朵来。”<br>　　Just then, looking at her, I could picture us sitting at her kitchen table once again, and I understood why I kept that flaky brown dandelion in our old family dictionary pressed between two crumpled24 bits of paper towel.<br>　　此时此刻，我凝望着我的母亲，脑海里又浮现出儿时的我和母亲一起坐在饭桌旁的情景，也明白了为什么我还珍藏着夹在我们家里那本旧字典中的那朵用两小块皱皱巴巴的纸巾压平的蒲公英。</p>\n<p>It was 1) a lovely spring day.

Brushing aside a bit of a spider ‘s web, he pointed the top box toward the light and began to carefully lift out one old photograph album after another. Eyes once bright but now dim searched longingly for the source that had drawn him here. It began with the fond memory of the love of his life, long gone, and somewhere in these albums was a photo of her he hoped to rediscover. Silent as a mouse, he patiently opened the long buried treasures and soon was lost in a sea of memories. Although his world had not stopped spinning when his wife left it, the past was more alive in his heart than his present aloneness. Setting aside one of the dusty albums, he pulled from the box what appeared to be a journal from his grown son’s childhood. He could not recall ever having seen it before, or that his son had ever kept a journal. Why did Elizabeth always save the children’s old junk? He wondered, shaking his white head.Opening the yellowed pages, he glanced over a short reading, and his lips curved in an unconscious smile. Even his eyes brightened as he read the words that spoke clear and sweet to his soul. It was the voice of the little boy who had grown up far too fast in this very house, and whose voice had grown fainter and fainter over the years. In the utter silence of the attic, the words of an innocent six-year-old worked their magic and carried the old man back to a time almost totally forgotten. Entry after entry stirred an emotional hunger in his heart like the longing a gardener feels in the winter for the fragrance of spring flowers. But it was accompanied by the fact that his son’s simple memories of those days were far different from his own. But how different? Reminded that he had kept a daily journal of his business activities over the years, he closed his son’s journal and turned to leave, having forgotten the cherished photo that originally triggered his search. Trying to avoid bumping his head, the old man stepped to the wooden stairs that led to the study. Opening a glass cabinet door, he reached in and pulled out an old business journal. Turning, he sat down at his desk and placed the two journals beside each other. His was leather-bound with his name printed neatly in gold, while his son’s had not been well kept and the name Jimmy had been nearly erased from its surface. He ran a long skinny finger over the letters, as though he could restore what had been worn away with time and use.As he opened his journal, the old man’s eyes fell upon a passage that stood out because it was so brief in comparison to other days’. In his own neat handwriting were these words: Wasted the whole day fishing with Jimmy. Didn’t catch a thing. With a deep sigh and a shaking hand, he took Jimmy’s journal and found the boy’s entry for the same day, June 4. Large letters, pressed deeply into the paper, read: Went fishing with my dad. Best day of my life.</p>\n<p>1 Her grandmother was always insisting that she was tooskinny and was never tiredof trying to force more food on her.2 They switched off all lights and waited for their lttle sister in thefaint___ light ofcandles, hoping to give her a birthday surprise.3 When they were talking about the education of children, his remarks on strict disciplinetriggered_ heated debate.4 Thanks to the _ emotional support from my family, I finally went through the tough timein my freshman year.5 Show your care to people youcherish__ most and let them feel they are important inyour life.6 He seemed so young and__ innocent_ that no one expected he’d have done things like that.</p>\n<p>1 Though upsetting events happened to the family_ one by one_, the family became closer than ever. 2 Water, if it drops continually, will make a stone disappear; this is true of our mind and efforts in front of difficulties. 3 The boy walked slowly to the door to go out, trying not to be noticed by his mother. 4 Feeling tired, he put his pen to one side and read over what he had written. 5 The children went together with their parents and teachers on their field trip on the Children’s Day. 6 She looks very short compared with other children of the same age.1 | had to bury myself in a stack of textbooks before the final exams, while my mother would always get me a glass of milk when I was tred. 2 We parked beneath a clump of trees a hundred meters away from the entrance of the museum. 3 He always brought with him a bunch of flowers for his mother when he came home. 4 In fact, without a clear searching target, you might be drown in a sea of information when surfing online. 5 The couple have an album of stamps from all over the world which make them remember their traveling in their early years. 6 Start budgeting and saving to repay student loans so you won’t face a mountain of debts for years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"翻译\">翻译<a href=\"#翻译\" title=\"翻译\"></a></h3><p>家庭对中国人来说极其重要;随着时代的发展，中国人的家庭观念也在发生着变化。</p>\n<p>The family is of crucial importance to Chinese people.

China in 2004,I took a short trip to Zhaoxian County in Hebei Province to see a bridge.A bridge?Yes.This was not just any bridge.It was the Zhaozhou Bridge,completed in AD 605,the earliest and best-preserved open-spandrel stone arch bridge in the world.In 1991,it was designated as the International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark,equally famous as the Eiffel Tower in Paris,the Panama Canal in Central America,and the Pyramids in Egypt.</p>\n<p>This experience helped shape my view of China as innovative.It informed my work over the next dozen years as a teacher and consultant working with private companies,state-owned enterprises,universities and government agencies.</p>\n<p>At college,I became familiar with China’s four great inventions:gunpowder,papermaking,printing and the compass.The inventions,in the words of the English philosopher Roger Bacon,changed the whole appearance and status of things in the world.For most Westerners,this is all we learned about China’s technological achievements.But,if we dig a little deeper,we will uncover a rich tradition of technological innovation.We learn that China’s global firsts include paper currency,oil wells,and even the explanation of the camera obscura.The list goes on and on.China was ahead of the time in some fields until the early years of the Qing Dynasty.Chinese discoveries and innovations contributed to the economic development of Asia and Europe.</p>\n<p>The rise of modern China’s technological achievements should not come as a surprise to anyone.It is built on a long history of innovation.Indeed,its achievements have captured global attention.For example,China’s progress in clean technology drew praise from Steven Chu,former Secretary of the US Department of Energy.He once identified several crucial technologies,mostly in the areas of power generation and transportation,where China is leading.</p>\n<p>High voltage transmission</p>\n<p>China has deployed the world’s first-class ultra-high voltage AC and DC lines—including one capable of delivering 6.4 gigawatt to Shanghai from a plant over 1,900 kilometers away in southwestern China.</p>\n<p>High-speed rail</p>\n<p>China’s high-speed railways have witnessed significant development in recent years.Its highspeed railway technology has reached the world’s advanced level and has been exported to other countries.China also has the world’s greatest high-speed network—22,000 kilometers at the end of 2016,or about 60 percent of the world’s total.</p>\n<p>Advanced coal technologies</p>\n<p>China is rapidly deploying supercritical and ultra-supercritical coal combustion plants,which have fewer emissions and are more efficient than conventional coal plants because they burn coal at much higher temperatures and pressures.</p>\n<p>Energy-saving and new-energy vehicles</p>\n<p>China has invested a lot in fuel economy,hybrids,and electric and fuel cell vehicles.It’s expected that at least one in every five cars

Engineering&amp;Technology,is the world’s fastest supercomputer,according to the TOP500 list of supercomputers released in November 2017.The Sunway TaihuLight was built entirely using processors designed and made in China.</p>\n<p>Likewise,China’s ambitious space program has been progressing at a rapid pace.China has given the world a first glimpse of its design for the space probe and rover which the country plans to use in its first mission to Mars in mid-2020.On August 16,2016,China launched a potentially groundbreaking quantum-enabled satellite,testing new communications technology.In early August 2016,its Jade Rabbit lunar rover shut down after operating on the Moon for 31 months.</p>\n<p>Where will China go from here?How will the rapid growth of technological innovations be developed and applied?Since 2014,China has been promoting mass entrepreneurship and innovation to cultivate grass-roots entrepreneurship throughout the country.According to the government,science and technology will contribute to 60 percent of the country’s economic growth in the near future.</p>\n<p>In addition to the top-down goal to upgrade its innovation capacity in order to stay competitive,China’s innovation drive is also being led by bottom-up factors such as the rise of Chinese entrepreneurs who are disrupting traditional industries.Technological influences are helping China leapfrog its innovation process.</p>\n<p>In my own work with private companies,state-owned enterprises,and government agencies,I have witnessed remarkable changes in the way technology is developed and applied to meet real world challenges.Particularly of importance has been the growing cooperation between private entrepreneurs and the government.From my experience,I am optimistic that China will achieve much in more technologies and that the development of grass-roots entrepreneurship will be successful.</p>\n<p>To encourage innovation, China 1) has been developing (develop) indigenous (本土的) technicalstandards. One example is the TD-SCDMA, the 3G standard. China initially 2)<strong>launched(launch) a national TD-SCDMA network in 2005, but the network only 3)</strong> reached(reach)large-scale commercial trials with 60,000 users across eight cities in 2008.

In the multimillion-dollar film series,Keanu Reeves’ character, Neo, found himselfliving between two worlds and fighting badguys, generally making the whole concept ofVR seem pretty cool.Entertaining, yes. But realistic?While the 1990s version of VR we werepromised in films like The Matrix and Thelawnmower Man might remain firmly on thesilver screen, VR is the future.And it’s something we need to pay attentionto. As we see, VR isn’t going away. Theclearest sign that VR is the future came inJuly 2014 when Facebook bought OculusVR for a cool $2 billion. VR is growing, andbecoming more accessible by the day. Soon,itll be as commonplace as an iPhone.</p>\n<p>Here are just a few predictions for how VR will change our lives.GamingAs we’ve already touched on the Oculus Rift headset, it makes sense to start withgaming. After all, this is the most obvious - and demonstrated - example of VR in action.Facebook wouldn’t have acquired Oculus had it not seen the potential in VR, anothersign that it’s only going to get bigger.Even before it has gone mainstream, Oculus already supports a vast number of games.And this list is growing all the time. Sony and Samsung are also releasing similar VRheadsets, and the increased competition will force designers to make their games andexperiences more intense, immersive and impressive.Watching films3D films are nothing new, but they’ re not really as exciting and three-dimensional asthe audience were expecting. Just imagine how much the film experience could beenhanced when we throw VR into the mix.We’d be in control of the movie world. We can look around as we want, see the action fromdifferent angles, and choose where to give our full attention. This is all still theoretical atthe moment, but it really could change the way we watch films in the future.</p>\n<p>Seeing the worldWe all get a desire to travel every now and again, but money, responsibilities and dailylife all get in the way of us hopping on a plane and jetting off to sunnier climates.VR could help us see the world, without leaving our living rooms. We could tourmuseums and monuments remotely, take in some amazing scenery, and even just relaxon a “beach” - all without a passport.SurgeryThis is one area where VR is already being used, as it’s safer for trainee surgeons toperfect their techniques in a realistic environment. Fully interactive models can sufferfrom a selection of ailments, and surgeons can learn new techniques and trainees canput theory into practice without an unrealistic plastic model, or the pressure of a real-life situation.Space explorationSpace travel is expensive, not to mention nearly impossible for Joe Bloggs. The chancesof heading off into space are pretty slim even if you’re an astronaut. But VR makes thisexpensive - and sometimes dangerous - exploration, much easier.Scientists can safely explore from ground control, heading out much deeper into spacethan would be humanly possible otherwise. It’s a really exciting way VR could changeour lives.</p>\n<p>Training and developmentPilots already use flight simulators but, like surgeons, could seriously benefit fromsomething a lot more realistic to help perfect their skills. There are already a wholehost of games where we can develop our skills, but even real pilots could benefit fromthe level of immersion virtual reality has to offer.Improving quality of life Lastly - but by no means least - virtual reality has the potential to transform the livesof those who aren’t capable of living a normal life. It gives them the opportunity toexplore and experience the world - even to do things we take for granted - and that’sthe biggest thing VR has to offer.The possibilities really are endless where virtual reality is concerned. It really doeshave the potential to change our lives and the world we live in. Time will tell whatkind of impact VR has, but one thing’s for sure - there’s so much more to virtual realitythan gaming.</p>\n<p>1 With the DSLR camera (数码单反相机) becoming more and more popular, its video functionhas really broken into the_ mainstream2 Smartphone apps can be brilliant, but | don’t think it___ realistic__ to expect the apps tosolve all our problems.3 As games blend our real and___ virtual_environments, should there be concern thatsome people will be less able to distinguish between the two?4 VR technology allows us to enjoy the___ scenery__ of a place without stepping outof home.5 Facebook is ready to make the application of virtual reality in our lives a(n) commonplace.6 NASA should provide its astronauts with lifetime health care for all ilnesses, even if theirailments_ do not necessarily stem from space.7 Chinese researchers have created a model for the_ prediction_ of cardiovascular (心血管的)disease risk, which will help prevent and manage the disease.8 A___vastnumber of vendors in China use WeChat’s wallet, so even if you buy aroasted sweet potato on the street, you will probably be able to pay with it.</p>\n<p>Though it is a sci-fi movie for children, it is by no means as simple as it may have firstappeared; it runs a strong sense of humor.We should be _ in control of the AI development, reaping its benefits and avoiding itspotential problems.Using technology in the classroom helps teachers satisfy students individually, not to mentionteach them how to find trustworthy sources online.It is said that if airlines saw the benefits of in-flight wi-fi_ in action , they would getplanes equipped faster.For sure__ we can come up with a way for the robot to ask a question when it is notsure of our commands.| resist getting a smartphone because I am afraid it would get in the way of enjoying my life,with all the temptations to waste time in a thousand different ways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"翻译-1\">翻译<a href=\"#翻译-1\" title=\"翻译\"></a></h3><p>中国的四大发明，即造纸术、指南针、火药、印刷术，对世界文明的发展产生了巨大影响。( have .an impact on; civilization )</p>\n<p> The four great inventions of China, namely papermaking, the compass,gunpowder and printing, have had a great impact on the development ofthe world civilization.</p>\n<p>高铁给人们带来了极大的便利，也改变着人们的生活方式和工作模式。( pattern )</p>\n<p> High-speed rail has brought much convenience to people, and has alsoaltered people’s lifestyles and work patterns.</p>\n<p>在创新战略的推动下，中国一批具有世界顶尖水平的企业在航天研究、生命科学、金融科技等领域脱颖而出。( world top-level; distinguish )</p>\n<p> Encouraged by the innovation strategy, a number of world top-level Chineseenterprises have distinguished themselves in such fields as space research,life science and financial technologies.</p>\n<p>明代著名医药学家李时珍运用观察和实验、比较和分类、分析和综合的方法，积累了医学研究新经验。( medical expert; classification; synthesis; gather )</p>\n<p>Li Shizhen, the famous medical expert in the Ming Dynasty, adoptedmethods of observation and experiments, comparison and classification, andanalysis and synthesis to gather new experience in medical research.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unit-8\">Unit 8<a href=\"#unit-8\" title=\"Unit 8\"></a></h2><h3 id=\"explore-1-2\">Explore 1<a href=\"#explore-1-2\" title=\"Explore 1\"></a></h3><p>The stereotype of the hard-working Chinese has been around for a long time in theWest. As early as 1894, Arthur Smith, an American who spent 54 years in China, wrotebooks introducing the hard-working Chinese people to the world. In his book ChineseCharacteristics, Smith wrote about the diligence of not just a single group of Chinesepeople, but of all the Chinese: young and old, rich and poor, farmers and scholars.Smith is not the only foreign guest to note that the Chinese are an extremely hard-working people. In 1895, another American in Beiing noted that Chinese people oftenworked from dawn to dusk, seven days a week, tirelessly. Later, in the early 20thcentury, British and American government officials serving in China also commentedthat Chinese people were without rest. Carl Crow, an American newspaperman andbusinessman who opened up the first Western advertising agency in Shanghai, oncesaid:“If it is true that the devil can only find work for idle hands, then China must be aplace of very limited satanic activities.”Chinese literature and folklore have many moral tales about industrious farmers andpeasants. The willingness to work hard and make maximum use of time has beenhighly valued in China since ancient times. There are many stories about farmers whogo to their fields even during holidays, or of peasants who think not only of themselvesand their families, but also of their community and future descendants.The Chinese trait of being unselfish and hard-working continues. Today, unselfishthinking, combined with the willingness to work hard, has given the Chinese a globalreputation of having a stable and industrious workforce. Western employers note thatthe values and beliefs of the Chinese workforce are compelling: The Chinese valueeducation, the virtue of hard work, and self improvement. Whether working in thefields or in the factories, they are willing to do more and go beyond the minimum,</p>\n<p>because they assume that their work will benefit them and their families. Because ofthis extended benefit, the Chinese do not complain about working hard.This work ethic is not only for adults. All over China you will find children and youngstudents attending classes outside their regular studies. Students take courses, oftenuntil late at night and during the weekends. Part of these activities may be related tothe intense competition that Chinese students face, but part of them are based upon thedesire to excel academically.Why do Chinese people work so hard, regardless of age or occupation?One answer rests in socialization. Chinese people are socialized differently from召Westerners. They grow up with different values, including a different estimation aboutthe importance of working hard. Hard work is considered a virtue in Chinese culture,as opposed to a necessity in American culture. For youth, Chinese textbooks and socialactivities emphasize this as well.Hard work is also part of the national ethic. The Chinese leadership is committed tobuilding the country into a strong, successful, global nation and the country urges itscitizens to participate in this process. Diligence is part of political awareness. Moreover,this political awareness fits into the economic ethic of Chinese entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>In China, an entrepreneur is not just a small-time private business owner. He issomeone who is willing to invest his resources (land, labor, capital) and look towarda long-term goal. The Chinese entrepreneur seeks to improve his life and also thematerial well-being of a group around him - his family, his community, and his nation.True, Chinese entrepreneurs want security. They tend to be conservative and frugal,in opposition to Western risk-takers. They also tend to seek to benefit the group ratherthan themselves alone. This ethic is found not just among businessmen, but in everyoccupation, gender and age. The quest for material gain, a financially secure family,and a peaceful, prosperous nation have been the goals of Chinese people for ages.Today, Chinese culture also has strategies that allow for economic mobility. By diversifyinginvestments and extended study, many Chinese have become not only secure but also verywealthy. Could the Western world learn something from Chinese diligence? CertainlyChina’s current economy reflects cultural values that benefit all people.</p>\n<p>a. the truth<br>b. the rain<br>C. clouds<br>d. friends’ expectations<br>e. enjoying the rain<br>f. spend the afternoon reading and make a pot of tea<br>g. damp weather and genuine rainforest</p>\n<p>I’ve got a deep secret few people understand and even fewer will admit to sharing.

The Eastern dragon, called long inChina, may seem like a completely differentcreature from the Western dragon. Theirbehavior, their symbolism, and what they meanto society are quite different. The East seems tovalue dragons for their magic and beauty andholds them in high respect. However, it is a quitedifferent case in the West where dragons arehistorically viewed as monsters.</p>\n<p>2 In Chinese culture, the dragon is a symbol of virtue. Unlike Western dragons, orientaldragons are usually seen as kind and benevolent. Dragons have long been a symbol inChinese folklore and art. Temples and shrines have been built to honor them. In fact,the Chinese are sometimes referred to as“the descendants of the dragon.”Through the symbol of the dragon, many Chinese see qualities which they desireand value such as heroism, wisdom and power. The dragon is a protector. Legendhas it that the dragon controls the rain, rivers, lakes and the seas; they can protect theinnocent and give them safety. In real life, the Chinese have the Year of the Dragon. Itis said that anyone born in this year will be healthy, wealthy and wise. Historically, thedragon was associated with the emperor of China and used as a symbol to representimperial power. In order to emphasize the association, emperors wore robes with a dragon design, sat on a throne with carved dragons, and had his palace decorated withdragon of various patterns.Dragon idioms are common in China. Chinese idioms are usually made up of fourChinese characters, called chengyu. Many Westerners are familiar with the movieCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but do not know that this movie title is an idiommeaning “talents in hiding.’Likewise, the Chinese may include the character for dragon (“龙”) when naminga child. The character appears in the names of two famous movie stars that allWesterners know, Jackie Chan (Chenglong, meaning “becoming a dragon”) and BruceLee (Li Xiaolong, implying a “small dragon”).At special festivals, especially the Dragon Boat Festival, also called DuanwuFestival, dragon boat races play an important part. Typically, these are boatspaddled by a team of up to 20 paddlers with a drummer and a steersman. Theboats are generally with decorative dragon heads and tails. Dragon boat racingis also an important part of celebrations by ethnic Chinese outside China. Forexample, the dragon boat races held annually at Echo Park Lake in Los Angeles,California, are very popular.</p>\n<p>Western dragons have traditionally been a symbol of evil. A typical Western dragonhas wings and sharp claws, and breathes fire. Many legends describe dragons asgreedy, keeping huge amounts of gold and other precious treasure. Dragons aremonsters to be conquered. They are seen to represent the dark side of humanity,including greed, lust, and violence. The conquest of a dragon represents theelimination of those evil instincts.An important English legend is Saint George and the Dragon, a tale of goodovercoming evil. As the story goes, there lived a dragon in a town and it oftenkilled the townspeople. One day when the king’s daughter was offered to thedragon, Saint George happened to travel here. He killed the dragon and rescuedthe princess.But not all Western dragons are considered monsters. To the west of England in Wales,the Red Dragon has long been a national symbol, and is not regarded as evil. TheWelsh myth tells the story of a red dragon that fought a lengthy battle with his foe andwas victorious. The Red Dragon is now depicted on the Welsh national flag.It can be almost impossible to talk about dragons without being influenced by one’scultural heritage. But, regardless of one’s culture, everyone can appreciate the beautyof the Nine Dragon Screen in Beiing’ s Forbidden City.</p>\n<p>For Chinese people, the Qingming Festival, also known as the Tomb Sweeping Day, is atime to honor ancestors.In the legend of the White Snake, in order torescueher husband Xu Xian, BaiSuzhen used her powers to flood the temple where he was imprisoned.After the_ conquest of the Xiongnu nomads (游牧民), the Han emperor sent Zhang Qianto travel westward on a mission of peace.At some festivals in China, people hang_ decorative_ lanterns outside their doors.The Zhuang ethnic___ minority is China’s largest minority group with a long historyand glorious culture.As the two most-visited cities by foreign tourists, Bejjing and Shanghai boast rich tourismresources and uniqueoriental_charm.</p>\n<p>As an auspicious (吉祥的) beast, kylin (麒麟) is heldhigh respect in China andis expected to bring harvest, fortune and longevity.You must have heardthe Great Wall in China.
